### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Aaron Gullickson. I am an Associate Professor of Sociology at the University of Oregon. I am also a total data science nerd, git evangelist, and open science advocate.

Most of my empirical work uses large scale census and survey data to look at issues of race mixing or racial ambiguity. I examine racial classification, identification, interracial marriage, and life outcomes by race. More recently, I have been getting interested in studying religious identity as well, particularly among the growing number of people with no formal religious affiliation. Since I started using git to track my research projects, all of my research projects are available publically as git repositories.

I am trained in a variety of statistical programs, but I almost exclusively use R in my work these days. In addition to my research, I teach a first-year graduate sequence in statistics that focuses heavily on the practical issues of data analysis. You can view the (WIP) textbook for that course [here](https://stat-analysis.netlify.app/) and see the repository that produces it [here](https://github.com/AaronGullickson/combined_stats). I am also excited to begin teaching a course for [Code Horizons](https://codehorizons.com/) specifically about using [GitHub for Data Analysis](https://codehorizons.com/Seminars/github-for-data-analysis/).

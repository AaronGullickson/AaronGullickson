### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Aaron Gullickson. I am an Associate Professor of Sociology at the University of Oregon. I am also a demographer by training, a total data science nerd, a git evangelist, and an open science advocate.

Most of my empirical work uses large scale census and survey data to look at issues of race mixing or racial ambiguity. I examine racial classification, identification, interracial marriage, and life outcomes by race. More recently, I have begun studying religious identity as well, particularly among the growing number of people with no formal religious affiliation. Since I started using git to track my research projects, all of my research projects are available publicly as git repositories.

I am trained in a variety of statistical programs, but I almost exclusively use [R](https://www.r-project.org/) in my work these days. In addition to my research, I teach a first-year graduate sequence in statistics that focuses heavily on the practical issues of data analysis. You can view the (WIP) statistics textbook for that course [here](https://stat-analysis.netlify.app/) and see the repository that produces it [here](https://github.com/AaronGullickson/stat_book). I have also written a [companion textbook](https://practical-data-analysis-r.netlify.app/) that focuses on the practical side of managing a quantitative research project in *R* (repository is [here](https://github.com/AaronGullickson/practical_analysis)). I also teach courses for [Code Horizons](https://codehorizons.com/) specifically about using [Version Control for Data Analysis using GitHub](https://codehorizons.com/Seminars/version-control-for-data-analysis-using-github/) and [Reproducible Reports with Quarto and R Markdown](https://codehorizons.com/Seminars/reproducible-reports-with-quarto-and-r-markdown/).
